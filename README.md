# Snake JavaScript Game

Created a playable game based on JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling.
    - The game is based on handling some kind of event(s) (mouse, keyboard...).
    - The game mainly relies on DOM manipulation to move elements around on the screen or change their appearance (beside CSS of course).
    - The code is separated into several JavaScript functions.

The game or parts of it can be time-driven. This adds some complexity, as you have to change things around in given time intervals.
    - Some part of the game changes over time without any interaction (such as a moving enemy or avatar).

Implement a way to check the highest scores.
    - The highscore data is stored between games in a database. Scores can be linked to registered users. If the user is not registered, the score can be linked to a name.
